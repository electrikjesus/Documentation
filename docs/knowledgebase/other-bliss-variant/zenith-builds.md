# BlissOS Zenith

BlissOS Zenith is the new flagship build of BlissOS. Zenith is a BlissOS variant that is intended for "chasing the latest". We will build this variant weekly with only the latest version of BlissOS that is available, combine with latest Stable kernel. BlissOS is intended for people who are having a new hardware that LTS kernel can't support, or people who just want to get latest stable kernel to run on their builds.
