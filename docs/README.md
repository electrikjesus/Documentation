# BlissOS Documentation

Welcome to [BlissOS](https://blissos.org) Documentation, the main source of information related to BlissOS. We hope that you can find all of your answer you want in this page.

To start, check out the sidebar on the left for Table of contents

## But what is BlissOS ?

Pretty weird that you asked this considering that you are already on the Documentation page. [BlissOS](https://blissos.org) is an operating system based on [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/). Created by [BlissLabs](https://blisslabs.org/), BlissOS incorporates many customizations options & features to create a great experience when running Android on PC that are released for the last 10 years.

We've been doing this since Android 7.1 and still actively working on the OS.

## Great, but where should I start ? I'm new here !

To start, first you need to know about the [hardware requirement](knowledgebase/hardware-requirement.md) to be able to run the OS. 

Once you know that your hardware is capable of running BlissOS, head over to the [installation](Installation) section to choose the installation method of your choice to handle. For starter, installation media is our choice to install BlissOS.

If you see the main sites have many different variants (Generic, Surface, Go, Zenith) and wonder which one should you choose, check out [this page](knowledgebase/other-bliss-variant) and choose the variant you want to know.

You may have some questions and some of them might be on the [FAQs](knowledgebase/faq.md).
