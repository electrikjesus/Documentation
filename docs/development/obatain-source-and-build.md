# Obtain the source code and build

To be able to get the source code of BlissOS, first make sure you are familiar with [AOSP's source control tools](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/download/source-control-tools)

Since BlissOS 16, we've moved to a new Github organization. However, the way to obtain the source code remain the same. Everything you need is already written under the manifest's README.md file

* BlissOS 16.x : [https://github.com/BlissOS/platform_manifest/tree/typhoon-x86](https://github.com/BlissOS/platform_manifest/tree/typhoon-x86)
